# @package model.backbone_layers

enabled: true

# How to fuse predictions/features across selected backbone layers (multi-layer mode).
# Options:
# - mean    : uniform average
# - learned : learn softmax weights over layers
layer_fusion: mean

# When true, each selected backbone layer uses its own bottleneck MLP.
separate_bottlenecks: true

# Indices refer to DINOv3 transformer blocks (0-based).
