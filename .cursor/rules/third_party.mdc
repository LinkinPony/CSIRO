description: Disallow editing or direct imports from third_party; treat as pip-installed; code is reference-only

### Third-party code policy

- **Do not modify files under** `third_party/`.
- **Do not directly import from** `third_party/*` (e.g., `from third_party.dinov3 ...`).
- **Assume packages are installed via pip**; import the corresponding installed package instead of path-based imports.
- **Use the directory as reference only**; its contents are mirrors/snapshots for reading.
